About
A Final Year Student at IIT Patna, pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering and an inspired Machine Learning Researcher jaunting through different Research topics.
I want to understand things clearly. My interest lies in the area of Deep Learning and Statistical Machine Learning. Currently, my work is focussed towards generalizing deep learning methods across domains (also known as Domain Adaptation).
